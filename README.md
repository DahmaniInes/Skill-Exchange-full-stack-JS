## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.10+)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mind-spark.git
cd mind-spark

# Install frontend dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Run the App (Development)

Start backend and frontend simultaneously:

```bash
# Start the backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Open new terminal, start frontend
cd ../client
npm start
```

### Optional: Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up the React frontend, Node backend, and MongoDB service in containers.
